Overview:
This project implements a classic Breakout game using Python and the Pygame library. The game challenges players to control a paddle and keep a ball in play, bouncing it off bricks to destroy them and score points. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases, providing an engaging and challenging experience.

Project Goals:
Game Development: Create a fully functional Breakout game with increasing difficulty levels.
Dynamic Brick Colors: Implement a system where brick colors change dynamically based on their strength, providing visual feedback to the player.
Scoring and Lives System: Track player scores and manage lives, with the game ending when all lives are lost.
User Interaction: Enable user control via keyboard input to move the paddle and restart or quit the game as needed.

Game Features:
Paddle
Movement: The paddle can be moved left or right using the arrow keys.
Design: The paddle is represented as a blue rectangle, and its movement is restricted within the screen boundaries.
Ball
Behavior: The ball moves continuously, bouncing off the walls, paddle, and bricks. If it hits the bottom edge of the screen, the player loses a life.
Design: The ball is a small yellow circle that changes direction upon collision with other objects.
Bricks
Layout: The bricks are arranged in a grid, with 5 rows and 10 columns.
Strength and Colors: Bricks have varying strengths, which determine their color. The colors darken as the strength increases, providing visual cues to the player.
Destruction: When a brick is hit, its strength decreases. Once its strength reaches zero, the brick is destroyed, and the player scores points.
Game Loop and Levels
Levels: The game features multiple levels. When all bricks in a level are destroyed, the player advances to the next level, where the difficulty increases.
Lives: The player starts with three lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.
Score: The score increases as bricks are destroyed, and the current score is displayed on the screen.

Game Mechanics
Collision Detection
The game features collision detection between the ball and other game objects (paddle, bricks, and walls). The ball's direction changes based on the point of impact, ensuring a realistic gameplay experience.

Level Progression
As the player destroys all the bricks on the screen, the game progresses to the next level, increasing the difficulty by speeding up the ball or adding more challenging brick layouts.

Scoring System
The player's score increases by 10 points for each brick destroyed. The score, along with the player's remaining lives and the current level, is displayed on the screen during gameplay.
